# Plex metadata agent for Bierdopje.com

This is a metadata agent for [Plex](http://plexapp.com) fetches Dutch subtitles for TV shows from [Bierdopje.com](http://www.bierdopje.com/).

## Features

* It is capable of downloading Dutch, English or both subtitles
* It has smart recognition built it: it wil match all available results on bierdopje if no exact match is found. From those mathes it will fetch the closest match. This is based on various criteria like "HDTV", "DVDRiP", "720p", etc.
* It gives you the option to download the most popular (most downloaded) subtitle if no other matches are found. This might be handy if files are renamed and do not include any release details.
* It allows you to set your own [Bierdopje.com](http://www.bierdopje.com/) API key. This might come in handy if there are any problems with the default API key.

## Installation
